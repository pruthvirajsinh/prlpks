How to install

For fresh Install

1.run prlpks_install.sh
2.the script will output instructions after finishing compiling.
3.config file is self explanatory and must be configured fully before running.

Once you run the prlpks_install.sh next time you can use the original MakeFile_NoDownLoad which will use existing downloaded dependencies.

1.Rename Makefile to Makefile_Original
2.Rename Makefile_NoDownload to Makefile otherwise the dependencies will be unnecessarily downloaded.
