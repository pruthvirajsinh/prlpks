# Overview

SKS is a synchronizing public key server, which functions as a directory service
for OpenPGP keys. This charm can be used to deploy a standalone server or a
peering cluster of SKS instances.

# Installation

To deploy this charm you will need at a minimum: a cloud environment, working
Juju installation and a successful bootstrap. Once bootstrapped, deploy this
SKS charm with:

juju deploy sks

The service will automatically expose ports 11370 and 11371 when started.

Add an SKS peer with:

juju add-unit sks
