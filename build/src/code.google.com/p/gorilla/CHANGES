This file lists changes between tagged gorilla releases.

New releases are tagged twice, as "go1" and using the release
version, e.g. "r2012.04.05". So the go tool will always get the
latest version and a specific version can be pulled using its tag.

Changes that are not backward compatible are highligthed below
using an exclamation mark between brackets, as in "[!]".

gorilla r2012.05.04
-------------------
- [!] pat: renamed Router.Del method to Delete. It doesn't make sense
	to shorten the HTTP method name, even less to save only three
	letters.
- [Fix] sessions: when a session option's MaxAge is less than 0,
	a date in the past is set as the value for the Expires field.
- Added package css/scanner, a compliant tokenizer for CSS3.
- sessions: FilesystemStore's filenames now use alphanumeric
	characters only.
- sessions: when a session is created, default Options are set,
	so that session.Options is immediately available for use.
- schema: an error that is a map[path]error is returned in case of
	conversion errors. empty values are ignored.


gorilla r2012.04.13
-------------------
- [!] securecookie: changed decoding order to decrypt only after
	HMAC was successfully verified. As a result existing values
	will fail to decode.
- [Fix] mux: the StrictSlash option is now ignored when a path
	prefix is used. Thanks, Vasiliy Tolstov.
- [Fix] rpc/json: DecodeClientResponse now properly returns the
	error from the RPC call, if any, instead of trying to decode the
	result. Thanks, Graham Miller.
- [Fix] color: applied a workaround for inconsistent float64 to
	uint8 conversion in x86 and x64. Thanks, Guillermo Estrada.
- Added package appengine/context: it creates a testing context
	during tests but a standard appengine.Context when built in
	production. This was extracted from appengine/sessions.

gorilla r2012.04.05
-------------------
First stable release after Go 1.
